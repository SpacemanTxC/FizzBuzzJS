# FizzBuzzJS

<b>JavaScript FizzBuzz </b> app was created to practice working with Node.Js. The app will print out numbers 1-100 while
changing values divided by 3, 5, and 15 that get a remainder of zero. These values will become the terms "Fizz", "Buzz", & "FizzBuzz"
<br><br>

*Node js is Required to run application in terminal.*
